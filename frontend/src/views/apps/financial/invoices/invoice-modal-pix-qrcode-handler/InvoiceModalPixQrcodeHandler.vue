     ? This is handled quite differently in SFC due to deadlock of `useFormValidation` and this composition function.
     ? If we don't handle it the way it is being handled then either of two composition function used by this SFC get undefined as one of it's argument.
     * The Trick:

     * We created reactive property `clearFormData` and set to null so we can get `resetEventLocal` from `useCalendarEventHandler` composition function.
     * Once we get `resetEventLocal` function which is required by `useFormValidation` we will pass it to `useFormValidation` and in return we will get `clearForm` function which shall be original value of `clearFormData`.
     * Later we just assign `clearForm` to `clearFormData` and can resolve the deadlock. ðŸ˜Ž

     ? Behind The Scene
     ? When we passed it to `useCalendarEventHandler` for first time it will be null but right after it we are getting correct value (which is `clearForm`) and assigning that correct value.
     ? As `clearFormData` is reactive it is being changed from `null` to corrent value and thanks to reactivity it is also update in `useCalendarEventHandler` composition function and it is getting correct value in second time and can work w/o any issues.
